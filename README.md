# Advanced Programmable Digital Thermometer
A thermometer based on Arduino Uno and Neo Pixels

## Motivations
I need a thermometer in the living room to monitor the temperature. Most thermometers on the market are cheap, but ugly. Therefor I am motivated to create my own, that will be a nice addition the the living room.

## Specifications
Designed to be a simple thermometer with only the most necesary features.

- **Display temperature**
- **Look great**
- Indicate if there is a change in temperature, either positive or negative.
- Cost less the NOK 500,-

## Hardware
The hardware chosen i a Arduino Uno, and a Neo Pixel shield from Adafruit.

## Design
The design will be a *sandwich* design useing materials from Ponoko.

### Front plate
The front plate will cover the front of the Neo Pixel board. Due to the intensity of the Neo Pixels, it should diffuse the light, while keeping it readable. The choices is:

- Acrylic, Opal 3mm
- Acrylic, white (Matte 1-side) 3mm
- Delrin, white
 
#### Acrylic, opal 3mm
Great look, but might be to thick and diffuse.

#### Acrylic, whote (Matte 1-side) 3mm
Could look nice. Matte on one side means the light will only be slight diffuse. Glossy finnish ouside will look great.

#### Delrin, white
Great diffuser and availible in different sizes, but is prone to scraches, and is not ideal for the front.

### Box
